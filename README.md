# Python Basics → Advanced Agentic AI 

## 🚀 Mission

This repository documents my structured 16-week journey from Python fundamentals to building production-grade Agentic AI systems.

Goal:
- Master AI foundations (Math + ML + Deep Learning)
- Understand Transformers & LLM Internals
- Build RAG systems
- Design Memory-enabled AI
- Implement Multi-Agent Architectures
- Develop Production-Ready AI Applications
